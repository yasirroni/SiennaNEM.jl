# NOTE:
#   The `horizon = Hour(T)` parameter defines the optimization window span of T
# hours for each decision model. The `interval = Hour(I)` parameter defines the
# sliding window shift of I hours between consecutive time slices, starting from
# the minimum date in `minimum(data["demand_l_ts"][!, :date])`.
#
#   For example, with horizon=48 and interval=24:
#   - Window 1: Hours 0-47
#   - Window 2: Hours 24-71 (overlaps 24 hours with Window 1)
#   - Window 3: Hours 48-95, etc.
#
#   When interval < horizon, windows overlap. When interval = horizon, windows
# are sequential without overlap. When interval > horizon, there will be gaps
# between windows.
#
#   Trade-offs:
#   - Larger horizon: Longer optimization windows, better long-term decisions.
#   - Smaller interval: More frequent re-optimization and overlapping solutions,
#     but have more flexibility in selecting time slices that will be used, 
#
#   Note: In `run_decision_model_loop`, the full `horizon` is always used for
# each optimization window. Initial conditions (generator status, storage SoC,
# etc.) do NOT propagate between windows in the current implementation due to
# bug in Sienna.
